# My website
All the files that host my website! Yep, it's fully open source. This is actually [generated from a theme](https://github.com/monotiller/flyhigh) that myself and [@Ahhhh-man](https://github.com/Ahhhh-man) are developing. So if you find an issue with the site that you think needs fixing drop in an [issue](https://github.com/monotiller/flyhigh/issues), else, swing by the [discussions](https://github.com/monotiller/monotiller.github.io/discussions) page and say hi!
